<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

</div>
<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Data is not property, at least not in the modern sense of the word.
But if we look back over time, we see different notions of property. In
particular, associated with different resources. For example, common
land is a particular type of property, which may or may not be
explicitly owned, but members of a community have a particular set of
rights to.</p>
<p>In Sheffield, where I used to live, work, run and cycle. The moorland
was historically common land until the enclosures acts applied in the
1860s. Until that time, local people had the right to, for example,
collect sand from the moorland for use in building their houses. After
enclosure, the crime of ‘sand poaching’ evolved. On Houndkirk Moor,
south West of Sheffield, after enclosure <a
href="https://slidelegend.com/from-cairns-to-craters-conservation-heritage-moors-for-the-future_59e1b4f91723dd4240b3158c.html">sand
poachers went to collect sand at night</a> for houses being built in the
village of Dore.</p>

<p>Computational Biologists at the forefront of data sharing,
particularly public data sharing. Transcriptomic, genomic, epigenomic
data is publicly available and have allowed people, like me, not even
working directly with biologists to develop algorithms for interpreting
and analyzing that data.</p>
<p>But as we transition from biological data to health data, that data
starts to pertain to individuals. It falls under the domain of personal
data.</p>
<p>These rights to a resource become particularly interesting when
considering rivers. Sheffield itself emerged as the home of cutlers,
knife makers. Their small mills were driven by water-power flowing from
Houndkirk Moor to the center of town. There the lakes they built are
called dams, today they line the streams of the city’s parkland, but 200
years ago they were a bustling industry of forges, grinders and
polishers.</p>
<p>Important, regardless of who owned the river, different mills on the
river had different rights to the water. If an upstream mill damns the
entire flow, the downstream mill has to stop working in times of
drought.</p>
<p>The rivers of Sheffield are streams, but as they flow down into the
Don and eventually the Humber new rights to this water emerge. As well
as power from the river, there is its use as a source of drinking water,
for navigation and for irrigation.</p>

<p>Many of these rights are in tension. Mills working on the river may
pollute the stream. If the water is damned or used for irrigation, then
it can be too low for navigation. There is complex interplay of demands
on the river that creates tensions between different users.</p>
<p>The general data protection regulation is poorly named. It doesn’t
protect data, what it does instead is give us some limited rights around
access to and control of processing of our personal data.</p>
<p>Personal data has some of the characteristics of a river. My choice
to share my data has effects on other individuals. If I share my genome,
I am sharing information about my children’s genome. If I share my
address book (e.g. with Facebook or Linkedin) I’m sharing information
about what people know me. If I share a photo of myself with friends,
I’m sharing the location of friends.</p>
<p>What the GDPR does is give us limited personal data rights. It
outlines a limited right of deletion. It also allows us access to our
personal data, which in turn confers a portability right.</p>
<p>A pure notion of ownership, in that I own a ball, or I own a car, is
that I have the absolute right to share and restrict access to my
property as I choose. Personal data rights are not absolute, but
nevertheless they return some control to the individual.</p>
<h2 id="gdpr-origins">GDPR Origins</h2>
<div style="text-align:right">
<span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span

</div>
<p>There’s been much recent talk about GDPR, much of it implying that
the recent incarnation is radically different from previous
incarnations. While the most recent iteration began to be developed in
2012, but in reality, its origins are much older. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_protection_of_individuals_with_regard_to_automatic_processing_of_personal_data">It
dates back to 1981</a>, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day">28th January is
“Data Potection day”</a>. The essence of the law didn’t change much in
the previous iterations. The critical chance was the size of the fines
that the EU stipulated may be imposed for infringements. Paul Nemitz,
who was closely involved with the drafting, told me that they were
initially inspired by competition law, which levies fines of 10% of
international revenue. The final implementation is restricted to 5%, but
it’s worth pointing out that Facebook’s fine (imposed in the US by the
FTC) was $5 billion dollars. Or approximately 7% of their international
revenue at the time.</p>
<p>So the big change is the seriousness with which regulators are taking
breaches of the intent of GDPR. And indeed, this newfound will on behalf
of the EU led to an amount of panic around companies who rushed to see
if they were complying with this strengthened legislation.</p>
<p>But is it really the big bad regulator coming down hard on the poor
scientist or company, just trying to do an honest day’s work? I would
argue not. The stipulations of the GDPR include fairly simple things
like the ‘right to an explanation’ for consequential decision-making. Or
the right to deletion, to remove personal private data from a corporate
data ecosystem.</p>
<p>Guardian article on <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/05/digital-oligarchy-algorithms-personal-data">Digital
Oligarchies</a></p>
<p>While these are new stipulations, if you reverse the argument and ask
a company “would it not be a good thing if you could explain why your
automated decision making system is making decision X about customer Y”
seems perfectly reasonable. Or “Would it not be a good thing if we knew
that we were capable of deleting customer Z’s data from our systems,
rather than being concerned that it may be lying unregistered in an S3
bucket somewhere?”.</p>
<p>Phrased in this way, you can see that GDPR perhaps would better stand
for “Good Data Practice Rules”, and should really be being adopted by
the scientist, the company or whoever in an effort to respect the rights
of the people they aim to serve.</p>
<p>So how do Data Trusts fit into this landscape? Well it’s appropriate
that we’ve mentioned the commons, because a current challenge is how we
manage data rights within our community. And the situation is rather
akin to that which one might have found in a feudal village (in the days
before Houndkirk Moor was enclosed).</p>

<p>Figure: Feudal systems consist of serfs and vassals who are under the
protection of a Lord. The Lord has a duty of care over the vassals, but
due to power asymmetries that duty of care can be difficult to monitor
and enforce. This is similar to the way our information is managed. Data
controllers have a duty of care towards their data subjects, but there
is also a power asymmetry between controller and subject.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our current information infrastructure bears a close relation with
<em>feudal systems</em> of government. In the feudal system a lord had a
duty of care over his serfs and vassals, a duty to protect subjects. But
in practice there was a power-asymetry. In feudal days protection was
against Viking raiders, today, it is against information raiders.
However, when there is an information leak, when there is some failure
in protections, it is already too late.</p>
<p>Alternatively, our data is publicly shared, as in an information
commons. Akin to common land of the medieval village. But just as
commons were subject to overgrazing and poor management, so it is that
much of our data cannot be managed in this way. In particularly
personal, sensitive data.</p>
<p>I explored this idea further in this Guardian article on <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/Information%20Barons">2015/nov/16/information-barons-threaten-autonomy-privacy-online</a>.</p>
<p>So how do we regulate for such an eventuality? I’m fond of a quote
from Rodney Brooks that says: “You can’t regulate what doesn’t exist”.
Indeed, it seems we have enough problems with regulating technologies
and ideas that already exist today. But again, we can be inspired by the
way that regulation has evolved in the past to take into account
evolving technology. In particular, in intellectual property, patents
emerged from the notion of ‘letters patent’, which were monopolies
granted by the monarch for a guild to work in a certain domain, such as
weaving. They have evolved to be a mechanism for intellectual property
rights.</p>
<p>Similarly, when motorised vehicles were introduced, after some false
starts (including the poorly formed Red Flag Act) a Highway Code emerged
that lays out the different responsibilities of road users in sharing
the highway.</p>

<p>What mechanism should we look to for forming these ‘data
collectives’. There are many inspirations from history including credit
unions, building societies, co-operatives and land societies. Many of
these have the bottom-up flavour of a collective that feels appropriate
for managing data rights.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting mechanism also dates back to Medieval
law. The Courts of Equity is a separate system of law that runs
alongside Common Law. One of the domains of law it recognises are
Trusts.</p>
<p>Trusts are institutions where there is an enhanced duty of care,
known as “fiducirary duty” or “undivided loyalty” over the trustees to
implement the constituent terms of the trust.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking a Trust has three components. There are the
settlors. This group is the group that starts with assets. These might
be rights to the property, or in the data trust, the rights to data.
Then there are the beneficiaries. This is the group that will benefit
from the operation of the trust. Finally there are the Trustees. This
group oversees the management of the trust and ensures that the settlors
intent is being conformed to in the management of the assets.</p>
<p>In a Data Trust <span class="citation"
data-cites="Delacroix:trusts19">(Delacroix and Lawrence, 2019)</span>
the settlors and the beneficiaries will be the same, or significantly
overlapping groups. Unusually, because the value of data only comes when
it accumulates, it is only once the data is within the Trust that it
becomes useful. In the data trust, the Trustee takes on the role of
data-controller. But they are now obliged to conform to the
constitutional terms of the trust that is formed.</p>
<p>The data trust is not a specfic solution for data sharing. It is a
set of legal mechanisms that can be used to create solutions. The
consitutional terms of the trust will depend on what data is being
shared and for what purpose. One can imagine data trusts that are
associated with special interests, like a group of patients with a
particular cancer. Or data trusts that might be associated with a region
(the Hackney Data Trust) for assisting with local issues like transport
links etc. Or one could imagine general data trusts, that would interact
with individual specialized data trusts.</p>

<p>Importantly, any data governance approach is going to have tensions.
In particular, there is a need to represent the interests of the
<em>individual</em>, the interests of <em>society</em> and those of
<em>vulnerable people</em> (such as children). Any data constitutional
terms should also consider issues such as <em>enfranchisement</em> of
the data subjects. There is a <a
href="https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/selectingdatastructures">value based
choice for how particular data should be shared</a>.</p>
<p>But in order to enact such choices, and ensure that the correct
responsibilities are applied to the data controllers, Trust law seems a
promising avenue to pursue in institutionalising data sharing.</p>
